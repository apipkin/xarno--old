    <tr>
      <td>`default`</td>
      <td>`false`</td>
      <td>
        Tells parent widget this is the default button. Your application will need to interface this as it has no other purpose than state storage.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`icon`</td>
      <td>`default`</td>
      <td>
        Allows you to set the icon class for the button. This is used for skinning.

    <tr>
        <td>`iconPosition`</td>
        <td>`before`</td>
        <td>
            Placement of icon in relation to the button label. Options are `before` and `after`.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>`iconTemplate`</td>
        <td>`<span class="yui3-icon" />`</td>
        <td>
            Template used to generate the icon. Icons are typically used by CSS image placement, but this template allows you to add any icon markup required.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>`href`</td>
        <td>`null`</td>
        <td>
            Used in a link button. If `href` is `"#"` or falsey, the default action of the click event is prevented.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`title`</td>
      <td>`false`</td>
      <td>
        Automatically set with set label, adds a title to the button for accessibility purposes. The title can be set if on an icon only button (no label set).
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`type`</td>
      <td>`push`</td>
      <td>
        If `type` is `submit` or `reset`, the default click event will attempt to find a parent form element to submit or reset. If your button needs to submit or reset a form that it is not contained within, you will need to do the proper bindings in the `callback` config.
